# Wilt - JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA Theme

If you enjoy *actually* dark themes that filter out syntactical noise, it might be worth giving this a try.

## Installation

Clone the theme, and build it in IntelliJ IDEA (no JDK required). The resulting `jar` can be installed as a plugin from disk.

The specifics of installing plugins from disk this may change per IDEA version.
